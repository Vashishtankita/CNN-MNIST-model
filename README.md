# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of digits from 0 to 9.

## Features

- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset to improve model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: A deep learning model with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model on the MNIST training set, evaluates it on the test set, and provides accuracy metrics.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualizations of model performance metrics such as training/validation loss and accuracy.
- **Prediction**: Demonstrates the trained model's ability to predict digits on sample test images.


## Results

The trained CNN achieves a high classification accuracy on the MNIST test set, demonstrating its ability to distinguish handwritten digits effectively.
